## Range Addition II
### Description
Given an m*n matrix **M** initialized with all **0**'s and several update operations.
Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operations is represented by an arry with two positive integers a and b,which means M[i][j]
should be added by one for all 0<=i<a and 0<=j<b.
You need to count and return the number of maximun integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

Example 1
```java
Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

```
### Note  
1. The range of m and n is [1,40000].  
2.The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].  
3.The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.  
#### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        for(int i =0;i<ops.length;i++){
           m = Math.min(m,ops[i][0]);
           n = Math.min(n,ops[i][1]);

       }
       int count = m*n;
       System.out.println(count);
       return  count;
      
    }
}
```
除了暴力方法遍历矩阵计算，这种时候会超时因为数据量过大。
所以我们采用交集区域，最小覆盖，所以要寻找短板。
